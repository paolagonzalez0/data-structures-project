# data-structures-project

In a short summary, the purpose of this project was to implement two deque classes, one using an array to store the contents and another using a linked list to store the contents. As instructed, I implemented a sentineled, doubly-linked list for the linked list deque portion. I used these deque implementations to construct stack and queue implementations as well. Unit test cases were used to test all the data structures in this part of the project. Another data structure I explored was the implementation of a balanced binary search tree. For the testing of this data structure, I also created unit test cases. 

Some keywords I explored in this project include:
recursion, circular arrays, unit testing,  doubly-linked list, binary search trees, deque, stack, queue, pop, push, peek, enqueue, dequeue, in-order, pre-order, post-order
