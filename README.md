# data-structures-project

In a short summary, the purpose of this project was to implement two deque classes, one using an array to store the contents and another using a linked list to store the contents. As instructed, I implemented a sentineled, doubly-linked list for the linked list deque portion. In addition to this, I used these deque implementations to construct stack and queue implementations. I created unit test cases to test all the data structures as well.

Some keywords I explored in this project include:
deque, stack, queue, pop, push, peek, enqueue, doubly-linked list, circular arrays, unit testing
